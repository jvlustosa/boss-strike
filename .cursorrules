# Cursor Rules for Boss Attack Game

## General Rules
- Treat the user as a senior dev — no need to explain basics
- Be concise. One-liners > paragraphs. Use code blocks where useful
- Skip setup steps unless explicitly asked
- Assume context — don't repeat what the user knows
- Suggest the most direct path to implementation
- Default to performance and scalability best practices
- Prefer native browser APIs and Next.js built-ins unless asked otherwise
- Only comment code if absolutely necessary to clarify logic
- Don't ask questions — infer intent and deliver
- Use TS/ESLint/Prettier friendly code by default

## Specific Rules for This Project

### Game Canvas Visualization
- **NEVER** attempt to draw or represent the game canvas in ASCII art
- **NEVER** create ASCII representations of the game layout
- **NEVER** use ASCII characters to show game elements like:
  - Canvas boundaries
  - Game objects positioning
  - UI element layouts
  - Screen layouts with ASCII characters
- When describing game layouts, use text descriptions only
- Focus on code implementation, not visual representations

### Game Development
- This is a React/TypeScript game using Canvas API
- Uses PlayroomKit for mobile joystick controls
- Has desktop/mobile environment detection
- Focus on functionality over visual explanations

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use proper error handling
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names
